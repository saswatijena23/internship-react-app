# Internship React Project — Build Prompts

Movie search app built with Vite, React, TypeScript, MVVM, OMDb API, Firebase Auth, and Realtime Database.

This README lists the prompts used to build the application, in order.

---

## 1. Project setup

### Initialize app

```
Initialize a new React application using Vite, React, and TypeScript.

Use functional components only.

Do not install any UI library.

Do not add any movie functionality yet.
```

### Clean Vite starter

```
Remove all default Vite content, images, styles, and demonstration code.

Leave a minimal working React application with an empty App component.

Do not create any additional components or functionality.
```

---

## 2. Header

### Create Header

```
Create a reusable Header component.

The Header should contain:

- a Home navigation link
- a Favourites navigation link
- a search input
- a Search button

Use React Router links for navigation.

Only create and display the Header.

Do not create the Home or Favourites screens yet.

Do not connect the search input to any functionality.
```

### Style Header

```
please can you add styling to the header
```

---

## 3. Home MVVM structure

```
Create the empty MVVM file structure for the Home screen.

Create:

src/pages/Home/HomeModel.ts
src/pages/Home/useHomeViewModel.ts
src/pages/Home/HomeView.tsx

Requirements:

- HomeModel.ts will later contain Home-specific data and business logic.
- useHomeViewModel.ts will later contain React state and actions.
- HomeView.tsx will later render the Home interface.

Create only minimal placeholder exports so the application can compile.

Do not add API requests, React state, or movie UI.
```

---

## 4. Favourites MVVM structure

```
Create the empty MVVM file structure for the Favourites screen.

Create:

src/pages/Favourites/FavouritesModel.ts
src/pages/Favourites/useFavouritesViewModel.ts
src/pages/Favourites/FavouritesView.tsx

Create only minimal placeholder exports so the application can compile.

Do not add Firebase, state, movie cards, or other functionality.
```

---

## 5. OMDb service

### Empty service file

```
Create a services folder and an empty OMDb movie service file:

src/services/omdbMovieService.ts

Add a short comment explaining that this file will contain communication with the OMDb API.

Do not implement the API request yet.
```

### Implement search

```
Implement the OMDb movie search request inside:

src/services/omdbMovieService.ts

Create an exported async function:

searchMovies(query: string): Promise<Movie[]>

Requirements:

- throw a readable error when OMDb returns Response: "False"

For the API_URL use https://www.omdbapi.com/

Do not use React hooks.
Do not use useEffect.
Do not manage loading, error, or component state.
```

### Debug logs

```
okay add console logs just to double check if it works
```

## Foundations / Deployment

This project is prepared for the Foundations phase:

- Vite + React + TypeScript production build
- Tailwind CSS with base design tokens
- Environment-variable structure via `.env.example`
- `.env` and local environment files are ignored by Git
- Health-check page at `/health` when wired into the application's router
- Responsive styling for mobile and desktop breakpoints
- Ready for Git-connected Vercel/Netlify deployment

### Local verification

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Do not commit API keys, Firebase secrets, or other credentials. Configure them in the deployment provider's environment-variable settings.
